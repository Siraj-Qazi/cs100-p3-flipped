# Project 3: Flipped

### Description

This is C Programming Project 3 of a CS 100 Computer Science I For Majors course that I took as practice for string manipulation etc. in C.

### Prerequisites

```
 C11
```

### Building and Running

Compile with gcc:

```
gcc flipped.c -o flipped
```

To execute:

```
./flipped
```

### Project Requirements (from PDF)

This project takes text (strings) and outputs the text flipped.
The text will be printed right to left on right-justified lines of a given width. As an example,
consider the input:
`Hello there! General Kenobi... You are a bold one!`

This text flipped is:
`!eno dlob a era uoY ...iboneK lareneG !ereht olleH`

Two sample executions of the program using I/O redirection are shown below. The stdout
redirect is optional, but may be useful for testing. The last line of numbers is the column
numbers and needs to be in your output. Your output should match the example output exactly.
All input must be from stdin and all output must be to stdout.
